the only issue that could happen is that trainingData.txt when run is encoded in UTF 16 LE
to resolve this click on file->save as-> convert it to UTF 8

possible tweaks for fun -> eta, alpha, try changing training data and implement different stuff

how to run code -> 

g++ makeTrainingSamples.cpp -o makeTrainingSamples
./makeTrainingSamples > trainingData.txt
g++ NeuralNet.cpp -o NeuralNet
.\NeuralNet > out.txt
notepad out.txt
